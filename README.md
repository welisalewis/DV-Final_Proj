Does the population of a country play an important factor in determining it's GDP?
Author: Welisa Lewis

The Gross Domestic PRoduct(GDP) of a country is the financial value of all finished goods and services made within the country for a specific preiod of time. It is one factor that is taken into consideration while determining a country's progress. It gives us an idea about the country's economy. In this article we will look at how the population of a country may be an important factor that contributes towards the countries GDP.
In Section 1 of this article we can see a scatter plot which gives us a correlation between the GDP (per capita) and population of our primary dataset(countries of the world). The visulation has a panzoom feature which allows users to zoom in and out of the plot. In the plot we can observe the concentartion of scatters on one side, this tells us that in this particular dataset, the population of a country does not have a strong effect on the GDP of a country.
In the next part, we take a look at ten countries that have the Highest and Lowest GDP and plot a bar graph for better understanding.
Section 2, gives us more details and helps us verify results derived from section 1.
Section 3, provides insights about a country which are either related to it's population or GDP.

GDP per capita distribution on the world map
The visulation below gives us the distribution of GDP around the world. The regions which appear darker have higher GDP's compared to the regions that are lighter in color. Through this map it is easier to identify regions and wghat their overall GDP contribution is in the world.

Mean Population Distribution according to Regions
This visualization gives us a breakdown of the mean population according to regions. Through this we can identify which region has a larger population.Through this we can assume that countries in a particular region may have higher GDP's.

Section 1
This visualization gives us the correlation between population and GDP. Here we can see that the population and GDP are not strongly correlated. We can zoom into the visualization to view a particular segment more clearly.

Top 10 countries with highest GDP
Now we try to determine the top 10 countries with the highest GDP using our primary dataset.
The results we obtained for the Top 10 countries are as follows:
1.Luxembourg
2.Norway
3.United States
4.Bermuda
5.Cayman Islands
6.San Marino
7.Switzerland
8.Denmark
9.Iceland
10.Austria

Now we try to determine the 10 countries with the lowest GDP using our primary dataset.
The results we obtained for the 10 countries are as follows:
1.East Timor
2.Sierra Leone
3.Somalia
4.Burundi
5.Gaza strip
6.Malawi
7.Tanzania
8.Afghanistan
9.Comoros
10.Congo, Dem. Rep

Section 2
In Section 2, we look at our secondary dataset to verify the results obtained from our primary dataset. From our primary dataset (Section 1) we got the following results:
Ten countries with highest GDP :

1.Luxembourg 2.Norway 3.United States 4.Bermuda 5.Cayman Islands 6.San Marino 7. Switzerland 8. Denmark 9.Iceland 10.Austria

Ten countries with lowest GDP:

1.East Timor 2. Sierra Leone 3. Somalia 4. Burundi 5.Gaza strip 6. Malawi 7.Tanzania 8.Afghanistan 9. Comoros 10.Congo, Dem. Rep
We can see the above results visualizaed as bar charts in section 1.

After analyzing our secondary dataset, we get the following results:
Countries with highest GDP :

1.Liechtenstein 2.Monaco 3.Luxembourg 4.Bermuda 5.Switzerland 6.China 7.Norway 8.Qatar 9.Cayman Islands 10.Ireland

Countries with highest GDP:

1.American Samona 2.Bonnaire 3.Channel Islands 4.Falkland Islands 5.Faroe Islands 6.French Guiana 7.Gibraltar 8.Guadeloupe 9.Guam 10.Holy See

From the plots in section 1 and section 2, we can say that the countries with the highest GDP are more or less the same, however the countries with lowest GDP are not consistent. From section 1 we can also determine that population does not play an important role on the GDP of a country

The above visualization represents the Top Ten Countries with strongest GDP according to secondary data:
1.Liechtenstein
2.Monaco
3.Luxembourg
4.Bermuda
5.Switzerland
6.China
7.Norway
8.Qatar
9.Cayman Islands
10.Ireland

The above visualization represents the ten countries countries with the lowest GDP. They are as follows:
1.American Samona
2.Bonnaire
3.Channel Islands
4.Falkland Islands
5.Faroe Islands
6.French Guiana
7.Gibraltar
8.Guadeloupe
9.Guam
10.Holy See

After analyzing data from the primary and secondary dataset, the results of the countries with strongest GDP is similar, however, the countries with the lowest GDP keeps changing from time to time.

Section 3
In this section we have visualizations of certain aspects derived from the secondary dataset.
The first visualization is a hex bin which gives us a relationship between the Population and Urban population of the dataset.
The second visulaization gives us a correlation between the total health expenditure which is measured as a percentage of the GDP and with the GDP per capita.The second plot is a scatter plot
The third visualization is a histogram, it is the amount of Carbon dioxide emissions (million tons/tones per capita).Through the plot we can see that most of the emissions are limited within 20,000.

Figure3.1
The above visulaization gives us a correlation between the population and urban population of a country. Through the graph we realize that it is not necessary that the urban population is higher in regions where the population is higher. As we determined in the previous sections that GDP and Population are not strongly correlated, we can say that the Urban Population of a country does not have an affect on the country's GDP contribution.

Figure3.2
The above visualization is a graph between the Total health care expenditure of a country and it's GDP. The above is a scatter plot of GDP vs the healthcare expenditure. Healthcare expenditure is one of the most important factors to measure the progress of a country. Through the Graph we can see that countries spend a mojor percentage on healthcare. We expected that countries with lower GDP may spend a lower percentage on their healthercare, but our assumption is wrong according to this dataset.

Conclusion
From our two datasets, according to the data presnt in the datasets the population of a country is not a factor that contributes towards the GDP of the country. Through our datasets we were able to identify which countries have the highest GDP and which countries have the lowest GDP. We were also able to look at other statistics such as Urban Population, Heath Total Expenditure and how they are related to the GDP of a country.
